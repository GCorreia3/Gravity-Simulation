To do list:

Equation for binary with eliptical orbits

Change values for more real world data

Increase performance

Add a collision image or circle for the trajectory

Orbital decay due to gravitational waves - make it look visually nice
    - Find energy of object in binary system
    - Use equation to reduce the power of the binary system due to gravitational waves
    - Graph the distace/ other info over time for binary system


Finished:

Vector arrow class
Vector arrows for force and velocity

Spawn binary interface - allows you to modify values during runtime
